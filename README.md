## **IRAN IS BLEEDING --- AND THE WORLD IS SILENT**
BEGIN OF UPDATE: 2026-01-18

**The Slaughterer and Tyranny Regime of Mullahs is Slaughtering their protesting Nation and the Media was silent for a very long time!**

This Regime has killed at least 12000+ protestors in 48 hours (8th - 9th Jan. 2026),
after turning off the internet, Mobile-net, telephone-net and even electricity and the started to 
disturb the satellite frequencies by military jammers from china, to also turn off the internet connection through Starlink!

But some brave people which traveled to abroud smuggled a lot of images and videos, but also figures/statistics collected
by brave doctors in Iran. The figures/numbers currently after three weeks of protesting are:
- Death toll: 60000+
- Blined: 8000+

When the family of killed protestors try to get the dead body, they have to pay the "bullet-price" of 5000 to 7000 USD!
An average worker earns about 100 to 200 USD per month!

**The bodies of those whose relatives cannot afford the bullet-price are buried in mass graves without names or any other identifying information or markings at unknown locations.**

Car and ferniture are also confiscated.

**Now, after 120+ hours of internet-shuttdown, they turn it for some time on to transfere their BitCoins to wallets out of iran!**
